# Intial Version of Project #1: Activity Finder

## Concept
My idea is to make a website that uses an activity suggestion API to give the user suggestions on what to do. Each activity in the api has a type linked to it, so you could get an activity based on the type of activity you would like suggestions for. I could use p5 to make the site more visually appealing and interactive. The aim is to boost productivity and encourage people to try new activities and develop hobbies. 

## Process
For now, I just needed to make sure I could access the data from the API and get activity suggestions based on the type of activity. 
The API documentaion contains a list of 9 activity types, so I made a button for each type. When you click on it, the API will randomly give you an activity which is categorized under that type. (At this point, I'm not sure if these types are stored in an array so I took the long route and just wrote the javascript for each type, so my code is slightly redundant....) 


## Challenges
My initial idea was to make a website that suggested a movie to you based on the genre, however I could not figure out how to use any of the movie APIs that I found :( So I ended up looking for other options and found the Bored API --instead of suggesting movies it suggests activities. 

## Next Steps
Now, I need to think about how to incorporate p5.js into this concept, and I think I will utilize it to make the website feel more interactive and visually appealing. Instead of plain text buttons, I might make them into images or something of that sort. I also might look into the other information stored in the API, such as cost and accessibility of the activities, to use in my final site. 

## Conclusion
I'm looking forward to making more progress on this project soon, making a (hopefully) useful website.
