Gartic Phone is an online game that is meant to be played by 4-30 people, inspired by the popular childhood game, Telephone. In the original game, a phrase would be passed on from one person to another, and the end result would often be a completely different phrase from what was at the start. The online version has integrated drawing into the iconic game; the game starts by everyone in the group writing down an unusual or silly prompt, something like “a pigeon sipping a cup of coffee in a suit.” Then, each player is given  one of the prompts that everyone had written at the start to draw. The next player has to write down their guess to what the drawing is and the game continues with more drawing and guessing for a set number of rounds. The game ends with a showcase of each prompt and what came of it, and often the end results gave us a good laugh. I used to play this game over Zoom often with my friends and family, especially during quarantine. The outcome was always different and unpredictable, and it was always a memorable experience playing with friends who I hadn’t seen for a while. Although the game is online, there is no communication method between players built-in to the website, so you would have to invite players to an active voice or video call while playing the game. Upon playing the game several times with friends, I thought it would be easier if we had accounts linked to the website, so we could add each other and start off the game faster, rather than sending out an invite link and waiting for everyone to join the room. The changes I would make are focused mainly on improving the experience when playing with people online. Gartic Phone has added more creative game modes to their roster, making it more interesting to keep playing. One of the modes I enjoy the most is the animation mode, where you and your fellow players can start off a drawing, expecting the next player to add their own interpretation to the drawing, or continue telling a story. In the end, a gif is made compiling all the drawings made by the players in order, thus bringing the collaborative artwork to life! It is always very interesting to see how everyone else adds to what you started. Overall, I think the game is a really fun way of bonding with friends and family, whether it is played online or in person.
