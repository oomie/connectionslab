 ##  Campus Cats Website
  
  To start, I made 2 wireframes, here they are: (sorry I forgot to rotate the image)
  
  <img src="images/wireframe.jpg" width="350">
  
  I based my webpage on those two wireframes. I started by adding all the content I wanted to see on my page, such as the images of the cats (all taken from the campus cats instagram page) and the basic structure of the page. I also added a favicon of a little cat!
  
  As for the design, I went for a pale pink background and I made a header class that adds a dark pink box to emphasize the title. I made a little gallery with a couple of cat photos and their captions, and social media links at the bottom. I used flex commands to position the images (thank you flex froggy) and their captions, as well as the socials. I really liked the space-around alignment, it made the layout of my gallery look really neat. Another command I liked using was flex-end, to make sure my social media links were at the bottom of my page. I linked the campus cats facebook group, the instagram account and a youtube video I found titled "How to be an NYUAD campus cat".

Here's the link to my website! https://oomie.github.io/connectionslab/campuscats/
It's a pretty simple site, but I like the way it turned out overall.
