## Travel Diary
### Homework Week2 - Javascript interaction 

This week, our assignment was to make a webpage with javascript interaction elements. 
I decided to make a little travel diary, initially with two image galleries and a “comment section” similar to the to do list example.
I followed a youtube tutorial to make the gallery, but used swiper.js for it so I wasn’t sure if that counts. I ended up leaving the gallery at the bottom and adding a few pictures with captions below the header. When your mouse hovers on the images, they change to show another image from the same location. When you click on these images, an alert pops up that tells you where these pictures were taken. I decided to keep the swiper.js gallery at the bottom because I thought it would be a fun addition nonetheless. I also linked two google fonts to use in my webpage, one for headers/titles and the other for body text. There is a favicon as well!
